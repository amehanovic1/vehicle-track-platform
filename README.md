# AutoTrack Pro - Vehicle Management System

AutoTrack Pro is a secure, enterprise-grade platform designed for internal vehicle management across institutions such as ministries, government agencies, and large organizations. It helps manage everything related to vehicles â€” from registration, maintenance, and fuel usage to driver assignments, service requests, and traffic violations.

## System Overview

### Architecture

- Frontend: Angular (modular pages, JWT-based auth, reactive forms)
- Backend: Spring Boot (REST API, raw SQL via JDBC, layered services)
- Database: Oracle (triggers, views, scheduled backups)

### Additional Database Features

- Audit fields like CREATED_AT and MODIFIED_BY help track when and by whom records were changed
- Triggers automatically log changes across all tables for transparency and data consistency
- SQL views simplify reporting by grouping and aggregating key data
- Seed scripts initialize the database with default values for easy setup and testing
- Automated backups run daily, exporting all tables to CSV for reliable recovery if needed
